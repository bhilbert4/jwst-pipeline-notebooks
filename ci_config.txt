# ci_config.txt
#
# This file is used to specify custom runner sizes for specific Jupyter notebooks.
# Each line defines a notebook and its associated runner size, with the format:
# notebookName.ipynb:runnerSize
# 
# For example, to set a 16GB runner for notebook1.ipynb, add the following line:
# notebook1.ipynb:16gb-ubuntu
# 
# The runner size can be any valid GitHub runner size like 'ubuntu-latest', 'jwst-pipeline-notebooks-16gb', 'jwst-pipeline-notebooks-32gb'.
# If a notebook does not have a specified runner size, the default will be 'ubuntu-latest'.
#
# Add each notebook to this file with its desired runner size below:

notebooks/MIRI/MRS/JWPipeNB-MIRI-MRS.ipynb:jwst-pipeline-notebooks-16gb
notebooks/NIRISS/Imaging/JWPipeNB-niriss-imaging.ipynb:jwst-pipeline-notebooks-16gb
notebooks/NIRSPEC/BOTS/JWPipeNB-NIRSpec-BOTS.ipynb:jwst-pipeline-notebooks-32gb
notebooks/MIRI/LRS-slit/JWPipeNB-MIRI-LRS-slit.ipynb:jwst-pipeline-notebooks-32gb
notebooks/MIRI/Imaging-TSO/JWPipeNB-MIRI-imaging-TSO.ipynb:jwst-pipeline-notebooks-16gb
